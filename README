Some features:
* nearly full port of ngx_http_perl_module functionality
* support for native Nginx subrequests that calls passed JS callback with the response body
* cosy headers management (via Nginx.HeadersIn and Nginx.HeaderOut classes)
* environment variables handling with the code taken from Mozilla's js interpreter
* and working require() function that finds js-files walking through JSLIB env variable (like RUBYLIB and PERL5LIB)

The code uses ngx_assert() and ngx_log_debug() almost everywhere, so the debugging must not be a pain.
